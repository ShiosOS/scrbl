# scrbl
A simple command-line tool for managing your daily notes.

## Why scrbl?
After trying many different note-taking software and not finding a suitable match, I decided to keep my notes in a single, long Markdown file. However, I still had some issues:

1. Sometimes I would forget to save the file, which caused my notes to be lost at the end of the day
2. I wanted a faster way to add notes from the terminal to this file

## Features

### üöÄ Quick Note Management
```bash
scrbl write "I love neovim"                    # Add content to notes file
scrbl w "Quick note"                           # Short alias for write
scrbl append "Add to today's section"          # Append to current day
```

### üìù Daily Templates
```bash
scrbl create --daily                           # Create daily entry
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Editor Integration
```bash
scrbl edit                                     # Open notes in your editor
scrbl edit --editor code                      # Use specific editor
```

### üìä Status Dashboard
```bash
scrbl status                                   # View file stats, sync status, and activity
scrbl config                                   # Check current configuration
scrbl show                                     # Display recent notes with pretty formatting
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Sync (Optional)
```bash
scrbl sync setup                               # Configure sync with remote server
scrbl sync                                     # Manual sync
scrbl sync --auto                              # Enable automatic syncing
```

The sync feature is designed to work with a custom .NET API that you would need to build and deploy yourself. I built my own API and deployed it on a VPS, but the sync functionality is optional - scrbl works perfectly fine as a local-only tool.

#### API Requirements

If you want to implement sync functionality, your API needs these endpoints:

**Authentication**: All endpoints expect an `X-Api-Key` header for authentication.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request/Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `GET` | `/api/notes/metadata` | Get file metadata | Returns: `{ "lastModified": "2023-12-01T10:30:00Z" }` |
| `GET` | `/api/notes/content` | Download notes file | Returns: Raw file content as string |
| `POST` | `/api/notes/content` | Upload notes file | Body: `{ "content": "file content here" }` |

**Error Handling**:
- Return `401 Unauthorized` for invalid API keys
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for other errors

```

## File Structure
```
your-notes/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scrbl.md                    # Your main notes file
```

## Configuration

Scrbl stores its configuration in:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\scrbl\config.json`
- **Linux/Mac**: `~/.config/scrbl/config.json`

### Configuration Options
- **Notes File Path**: Location of your main notes file
- **Sync Settings**: Optional remote server URL and API key for cloud sync (requires custom API deployment)

Use `scrbl config` to view your current settings or `scrbl status` for a complete overview including file statistics and sync status.
