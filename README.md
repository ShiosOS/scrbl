# scrbl
A simple command-line tool for managing your daily notes.

## Why scrbl?
After trying many different note-taking software and not finding a suitable match, I decided to keep my notes in a single, long Markdown file. However, I still had some issues:

1. Sometimes I would forget to save the file, which caused my notes to be lost at the end of the day
2. I wanted a faster way to add notes from the terminal to this file

## Features

```bash
scrbl write "I love neovim"                    # Add content to notes file
scrbl w "Quick note"                           # Short alias for write
```

### üìù Daily Templates
