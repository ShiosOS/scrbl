# scrbl

[![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-9.0-purple.svg)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

A elegant command-line tool for managing your daily notes with optional cloud synchronization.

## Why scrbl?

After trying numerous note-taking applications without finding the perfect fit, scrbl was born from the idea of keeping notes in a single, long Markdown file. However, traditional file-based note-taking had some pain points:

- üíæ **Data Loss Risk**: Forgetting to save could lose an entire day's worth of notes
- ‚ö° **Slow Workflow**: No quick way to append notes directly from the terminal
- üîÑ **No Sync**: Difficulty accessing notes across multiple devices

scrbl solves these problems with automatic syncing, structured daily templates, and terminal integration.

## Features

### üöÄ Quick Note Management
```bash
scrbl append "I love neovim"                   # Add content to today's section
scrbl a "Quick note"                           # Short alias for append
```

### üìù Daily Templates
```bash
scrbl create --daily                           # Create structured daily entry
scrbl create -d                                # Short alias for daily creation
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Editor Integration
```bash
scrbl edit                                     # Open notes in your default editor
scrbl edit --editor code                      # Use specific editor (VS Code, vim, etc.)
```

### üìä Comprehensive Dashboard
```bash
scrbl status                                   # View file stats, sync status, and activity metrics
scrbl config                                   # Check current configuration with helpful tips
scrbl show                                     # Display recent notes with elegant formatting
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Sync (Optional)
```bash
scrbl setup                                    # Configure sync during initial setup
scrbl sync                                     # Manual sync with remote server
```

The sync feature works with a custom Web API that you can deploy on any server or cloud platform. The sync functionality is entirely optional - scrbl works perfectly as a local-only tool.

#### API Requirements

If you want to implement sync functionality, your API needs these endpoints:

**Authentication**: All endpoints expect an `X-Api-Key` header for authentication.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request/Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `GET` | `/api/notes/metadata` | Get file metadata | Returns: `{ "lastModified": "2023-12-01T10:30:00Z" }` |
| `GET` | `/api/notes/content` | Download notes file | Returns: Raw file content as string |
| `POST` | `/api/notes/content` | Upload notes file | Body: `{ "content": "file content here" }` |

**Error Handling**:
- Return `401 Unauthorized` for invalid API keys
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes for other errors

## Templates

### Daily Template Structure

When you run `scrbl create --daily`, scrbl generates:

```markdown
## 2024.08.28
### Daily Summary

```

This creates a consistent, date-organized structure that makes it easy to navigate your notes chronologically.

### File Organization

```
your-notes-directory/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scrbl.md                    # Your main notes file (auto-created)
```

The notes file uses a simple Markdown format that's readable in any text editor and works great with version control systems like Git.
