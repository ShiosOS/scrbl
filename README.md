# scrbl
A simple command-line tool to quickly add to daily notes

## Why scrbl
After trying many different note-taking software and not finding a suitable match, I decided to keep my notes in a single, long Markdown file. However, I still had some issues.

1. Sometimes I would forget to save the file, which caused my notes to be lost at the end of the day
2. I wanted a faster way to add notes from the terminal to this file

So now with scrbl I can manage my notes from the terminal like this:

```
scrbl write "I love neovim"
```

And I don't need to worry about saving or do a bunch of manual editing.
